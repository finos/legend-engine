/*
    A "flow" produces a credential that can be used to acquire a database connection.

    Producing a credential requires the following inputs :
    1/ identity - This is the caller identity e.g GSSSO cookie
    2/ datasource spec - This is metadata about the database to connect to e.g AWS account name
    3/ authentication spec - This is metadata that influences the type of credential to be produced e.g OAuth token

    We have cases where the type of the datasource spec does not uniquely identify the database type. e.g StaticDatasourceSpecification.
    To support these use cases, a flow declares the database type that it supports. This declared type is used in resolving a user request to the appropriate authentication flow.

    Thread Safety :
    A flow object can be accessed by multiple threads. Flow objects should be stateless and therefore thread safe. Or if they maintain state, the state should be thread safe.
    Acquiring a credential might require multiple network round trips. Holding locks for the entire duration of the flow might cause performance issues.

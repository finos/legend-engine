on:
  # Analysis done to check for security and quality are often taken care of by vendor tools, such as SonarCloud, CodeQL, etc.
  # We will not run these in PR pipelins for the following reasons:
  # 1. In terms of quality checks, these analysis are often already covered by code checks (e.g. eslint) already set to run
  #    for PRs
  # 2. Security checks are included meaning that these checks will have to go through a huge libraries of vulnerability checks
  #    from vendor, which could take up huge amount of time to run, which is not suitable to have in PR unless absolutely necessary.
  #    However, most of the problems detected by these checks are often security warnings and some other niche problems that we might
  #    or might not necessarily have to deal with (false positive, or belongs to test-only codepath)

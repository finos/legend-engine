# Testable Framework

Testable framework provides mechanism how developers of the platform can integrate their metamodels with the testing
framework
and provide mechanisms to platform users to safeguard their development by tests.

## Testable

Testable is an abstract concept modeled in platform which should be extended by all metamodels which needs to integrate
with platform testing.

Testable is designed to be very flexible to adapt to wide variety of testing requirements of platform metamodels. It is
modeled to just add ability to define a sets of sets.

Any packageable element which wants to integrate to platform testing framework is required to extend Testable model,
which in turn adds capability to define set of tests with packageable element instances.

# Search

## Overview

This module provides Pure methods and a build extension to generate summary documents for different types of
`PackageableElements` within the graph.

* [legend-engine-xt-analytics-search-pure](../../../legend-engine-xt-analytics-search-pure)
* [legend-engine-xt-analytics-search-generation](../../../legend-engine-xt-analytics-search-generation)

The documents can then to be loaded in to search solutions like [Elastic Search](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch).  
This can enable users to quickly search and discovery elements (e.g. `Service`, `Mapping`, etc.) across the different 
projects.
